# The `.git` subdirectory

Change directory to your new local clone of the repository, and list its contents.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ cd OBDS_Training_Jan_2022
$ ls -a
```

```
.  ..  .git  .gitignore  README.md
```

Git uses the `.git` sub-directory to store all the information about the project history.
You can have a brief look for yourself if you wish.
Make sure that you do not alter or remove anything in that sub-directory.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ ls -a .git/
```

#### Result

- Deleting the `.git` sub-directory is effectively discarding the _history_ of changes made to the repository.
- However, deleting the `.git` sub-directory does not affect the _current state_ of the other sub-directories and files that make up your project (e.g., `README.md`).

.center[
**Changes are stored separately from the files themselves.**
]

---

# Ignore files

One or more special files named `.gitignore` can be placed in your project.

Each line in those file specifies a file name or pattern that <i class="fab fa-git"></i> will ignore (i.e., not track) in the future.

- Files that are already tracked will continue to be tracked even after they are added to `.gitignore`, unless they are explicitly removed from the repository using `git rm` (use the `--cached` option to only remove the file from the index, but keep the file itself).

.pull-left[
## .gitignore
```

 *fastq.gz
 *sam
 *bam
```

**Can you tell which files will be tracked when this `.gitignore` exists in the project root directory?**

# Status of a repository

The `git status` sub-command can be used to check whether the repository is up-to-date.

On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

```

We will discuss later how to incorporate changes made on branches back into the `master` branch.

---

# Create a branch

The `git branch` sub-command can be used to inspect and create branches in a copy of the repository.

- This does not automatically synchronise remote copies of the repository.
- You can only create branches with names that are not already used (locally*).
- The new branch is created from the commit on the current branch (not necessarily `master`).

The `git checkout` sub-command can be used to switch between branches.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git branch          # list existing branches
$ git branch kevin    # create a new branch named kevin
$ git checkout kevin  # switch to the branch named kevin
$ git status          # check the status of the repository (currently on branch kevin)
```

**At this point, is there any difference between branch `master` and branch `kevin`?**

#### Alternative

It is possible to create and checkout the new branch in a single command.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git checkout -b kevin
```

---

# Make changes

First make sure that you have checked out a branch other than `master`.

In the repository sub-directory `week2day1-git`, create a file called `<username>.md`, replacing `<username>` by your own cluster user name (i.e. Bash command `whoami`).

> I included an example `kevinrue.md`.

In that file, write you full name as a first level header (preceded by a `#` symbol and a space).

As second level header (i.e., `##`), add a section 'Expertise' with a list of bullet points, and another second level header 'Operating System' to indicate whether you use 'macOS', 'Windows', or 'Linux' during this course.

It is best practice to add a newline character at the end of this line as <i class="fab fa-git"></i> works best in that case.

#### Practice Bash

You can also make a copy the example file and edit that copy, instead of creating the file from scratch yourself.

---

# Track changes

We have just made changes to files in the repository.
However, we have not told <i class="fab fa-git"></i> to record those changes yet.
In other words, we have edited the files on disk, but we haven't committed those changes in the repository.

> Remember that changes are separate from the files themselves!

The `git status` sub-command can be used to check the status of our project again.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git status
```

```
On branch kevin
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	week2day1-git/kevinrue.md
```

The "Untracked files" section reports files that are new and not track by <i class="fab fa-git"></i> yet.

---

# Track new files

The `git add` sub-command can be used to add new files to the list of files tracked by <i class="fab fa-git"></i>.

- As long as <i class="fab fa-git"></i> is not explicitly told to track new files, those files will exist in the _directory_ but not in the _repository_.
- In other words, the file will exist, but changes to that file will not be tracked, and we will not be able to restore past versions of that file.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git add kevinrue.md
$ git status
```

```
On branch kevin
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   week2day1-git/kevinrue.md
```

.center[
**What changed in `git status` after running `git add`?**
]

---

# The staging area

We just ran `git add`, which added a set of changes to the _staging area_.

- The _staging area_ contains the set of changes that will be recorded in the next _commit_.
- You may add to the _staging area_ only a subset of the changes that you have made in the repository since the latest _commit_.
- The _staging area_ can include changes made to multiple files.

The `git commit` sub-command can be used to add changes currently in the _staging area_ in the next _commit_ of the _repository_.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.height='200px', out.width='800px'}
# Source: https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/04-changes/index.html
knitr::include_graphics("img/carpentries-git-staging-area.svg")
```

---

# Record a set of changes 

The `git commit` sub-command can be used to add changes currently in the _staging area_ in the next _commit_ of the _repository_.

- The `-m` option can be used to specify the message used to annotate the _commit_ that will contain this set of changes. 

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git commit -m "Added a file for kevin rue"
```

```
[kevin 41121a3] Added a file for kevin rue

```

.center[
**What information do you recognise in the message displayed as a result of the `git commit` command?**
]

---

# Share your changes with others

The `git push` sub-command can be used to send local changes to a remote repository.

- The local repository must have configured the address of the remote repository.

Before we push, the `git remote` command can be used to inspect, add, and remove remote repositories from the local repository configuration.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git remote -v
```

```
origin	git@github.com:OBDS-Training/OBDS_Training_Jan_2022.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:OBDS-Training/OBDS_Training_Jan_2022.git (push)
```

When everything is in place, you can tell <i class="fab fa-git"></i> to push a branch (e.g. `my_branch`) to a given remote (e.g. `origin`):

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git push origin my_branch
```

# Push a new branch to a remote

The first time you push a branch, you should use the `--set-upstream` flag (or `-u` in short), and <i class="fab fa-git"></i> will display more information.

# Incorporate changes to the base branch

The `git merge` sub-command can be used to merge branches.
However, we are not going to use it, at least not explicitly at the command line.

- We do not want to create different (i.e., conflicting) histories on the `master` branch.
- We will use <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub to manage the `master` branch centrally.
- Every other repository will only ever `pull` the `master` branch from <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub.
- No one will ever directly `push` their `master` branch to <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.height='200px', out.width='600px'}
# Kevin Rue-Albrecht (Adobe Illustrator)

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git checkout master
$ git merge kevin

# Delete a branch locally

```

   remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master

To delete a branch locally, we need to move to another branch (often, `master`) first.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git fetch --prune   # remove local links to any branch deleted on the remote
$ git branch -D kevin # "politely" remove the local copy of the branch
$ git branch -D kevin # "force" remove the local copy of the branch

# The repository history

The `git log` sub-command can be used to display the history of commits in the repository.

- The `--all` option forces <i class="fab fa-git"></i> to display the repository history across all the branches.
  + By default, <i class="fab fa-git"></i> only displays the history of the branch currently checked out.
- The `--graph` option adds a visual representation of branches in the repository, and their connections to each other.
- The `--oneline` (i.e., "one line") forces <i class="fab fa-git"></i> to summarise each commit as a single line.
  + This limits the information displayed, but helps with the visualisation.

# View differences between commits

The `git diff` sub-command can be used to compare two states of the repository.

- It is possible to compare all the changes between a reference and a target commits using the syntax `git diff reference_commit target_commit`
  + The order of commit identifiers control the changes that are shown as "added" or "removed.
- It is also possible to compare the current state of files in the repository - including uncommitted changes - to any commit of the repository.
  + This is often used to examine the changes that you have made since the most recent commit.
