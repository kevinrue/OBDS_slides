## Import scRNA-seq data and create a Seurat object

- Load the `Seurat` package.

```{r}

```

- Use `Read10X()` to import data from the directory `filtered_feature_bc_matrix/` 
  as an object named `read10x_data` in your R session.

```{r}
read10x_data <- Read10X(
    
)
```

- Display the first 15 rows and 4 columns of the object using indexing.

```{r}

```

- Display the structure of the object using `str()`.
  What is a sparse matrix and how does it store data?

```{r}

```

> Answer:
> 

- How many features and barcodes (i.e., cells) are present in the data set?

```{r}

```

> Answer:
> 

- Create a Seurat object using the function `CreateSeuratObject()`.
  Name the object `seurat_object`.
  Include features detected in at least 3 cells,
  and cells where at least 200 features detected.
  Name the project `pbmc5k`.
  How many features and barcodes are left in the Seurat object?

```{r}
seurat_object <- CreateSeuratObject(
    
    
    
    
)
seurat_object
```

> Answer:
> 

- Combine the `dim()` function with the subtraction operator to determine how many features and cells were filtered out when you created the Seurat object.

```{r}
dim(   ) - dim(   )
```

# Exercise

## Accessing the contents of a Seurat object

- Use `DefaultAssay()` to query the name of the active assay in the Seurat object.

```{r}

```

- Use `Assays()` to list the names of assays available in the Seurat object.

```{r}

```

- Combine `GetAssayData()` and indexing to display the first six rows and four columns of the RNA assay data.
  What happens if you do not specify the `layer` argument?

```{r}

```

> Answer:
> 

- Combine `head()` and the `[[]]` operator to display the first few rows entire data.frame of per-cell metadata.

```{r}

```

- Use the `[[]]` operator to fetch only one column of metadata.
  What type of object do you get back?

```{r}

```

> Answer:
> 

- Instead, use the `$` operator to fetch the same column of metadata.
  What type of object do you get back this time?

```{r}

```

> Answer:
> 

- Use `FetchData()` to access the metadata column `"nCount_RNA"` and the counts of the gene named `"LYZ"`.
  Combine this with `head()` to display only the first few rows.
  What type of object do you get back?

```{r}
FetchData(   )
```

## Common operations on Seurat objects

`WhichCells()` returns the names of cells that match a logical expression.

```{r}
WhichCells(seurat_object, expression = LYZ > 300, slot = "counts")
```

`VariableFeatures()` returns the names of variable features (for a given assay, if computed).

```{r}
VariableFeatures(seurat_object)
```

`subset()` returns a new Seurat object restricted to certain features and cells.

```{r}
subset(
    x = seurat_object,
    cells = WhichCells(seurat_object, expression = LYZ > 300, slot = "counts"),
    features = VariableFeatures(object = seurat_object)
)
```

# Exercise

## Quality control and visualisation

- The library size and number of features detected per cell are already present in the per-cell metadata of the Seurat object, under the names `"nCount_RNA"` and `"nFeature_RNA"`.
  Use `VlnPlot()` to display them in a single violin plot.

```{r}
VlnPlot(   )
```

- Use `PercentageFeatureSet()` to compute the fraction of reads assigned to mitochondrial genes in each cell.
  Combine this with `AddMetaData()` to store the metric in the cell metadata of the Seurat object, under the name `"percent_mt"`.
  Finally, use `VlnPlot()` to visualise this new metric alongside the previous two in a new violin plot.

```{r}
   <- PercentageFeatureSet(
    
)
VlnPlot(   )
```

- Use `FeatureScatter()` to sisualise a scatter plot of the proportion of mitochondrial UMIs (`"percent_mt"`) on the Y-axis against the library size (`"nCount_RNA"`) on the X-axis.

```{r}

```

- Use `subset()` to create a new Seurat object, called `seurat_after_qc`, that contains only the cells that have more than 4,500 UMI counts, less than 15% of UMI counts assigned to mitochondrial genes, and more than 1,500 genes detected.

```{r}
seurat_after_qc <- subset(
    
    
)
seurat_after_qc
```

- Combine the `dim()` function with the subtraction operator to determine how many cells were removed in this step.

```{r}
dim(   ) - dim(   )
```

# Exercise

## Normalisation

- Use `NormalizeData()` to normalise the RNA assay of the Seurat object (after quality control) using the `"LogNormalize"` method.

```{r}
seurat_after_qc <- NormalizeData(
    
    
)
```

## Bonus

- Combine `ggplot()` and `FetchData()` to visualise the distribution of raw counts and normalised data for a gene of your choice.

```{r}
ggplot_lyz_raw <- ggplot(   ) +
    geom_histogram(   ) +
    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 500)) +
    cowplot::theme_cowplot()
ggplot_lyz_normalised <- ggplot(   ) +
    geom_histogram(   ) +
    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 500)) +
    cowplot::theme_cowplot()
cowplot::plot_grid(ggplot_lyz_raw, ggplot_lyz_normalised, ncol = 1)
```

# Exercise

## Variable features and scaling

- Use `FindVariableFeatures()` to identify variable features in the normalised RNA assay of the Seurat object.
  Use the `"vst"` method and select the 2,000 most variable features.
  What does this subsetting do, and what are our motivations for doing it?

```{r}
seurat_after_qc <- FindVariableFeatures(
    
)
```

> Answer:
> 

- Combine `VariableFeatures()` and `head()` to display the names of the first few variable features in the Seurat object.
  How can you control which assay the variable features are pull from?

```{r}

```

> Answer:
> 

- Use `VariableFeaturePlot()` to visualise the scatter plot of standardised variance against average expression.
  How would you use this plot?

```{r}
VariableFeaturePlot(   )
```

> Answer:
> 

- Use `ScaleData()` to scale the normalised RNA assay of the Seurat object, regressing the the fraction of UMI counts assigned to mitochondrial features.
  What are the motivations for removing that source of variation?

```{r}
seurat_after_qc <- ScaleData(
    
    
)
```

# Exercise

## Dimensionality reduction

- Use `RunPCA()` to run a principal component analysis on the Seurat object.
  Which features are used by the method in the default settings?
  How could you change this?
  How do you read the message displayed by the function `RunPCA()`?

```{r}
seurat_after_qc <- RunPCA(   )
```

> Answer:
> 

- Use `Reductions()` to list the names of dimensionality reduction results available in the Seurat object.

```{r}

```

- Use `PCAPlot()` or `DimPlot()` to produce a scatterplot of the first and second PCA components.

```{r}
PCAPlot(   )
```

```{r}
DimPlot(   )
```

## Bonus

- Use `ggplot()` to make a scatterplot of the first and second PCA components.

```{r}
# Use this code chunk to prepare a data.frame for ggplot2
pca_data <- FetchData(   )
head(pca_data)
```

```{r}
# Use this code chunk to call ggplot()
ggplot(pca_data,   ) +
    geom_point(size = 0.2) +
    cowplot::theme_cowplot()
```

- Use `ElbowPlot()` to visualise the amount of variance explained the principal components that capture most variance.
  Use argument `ndims` to control the number of principal components to plot.
  How many principal components would you use for downstream analyses?

```{r}
ElbowPlot(   )
```

> 

- Use `RunUMAP()` to run the UMAP technique on your selected number of principal components.

```{r}
seurat_after_qc <- RunUMAP(   )
UMAPPlot(seurat_after_qc)
```

# Exercise

## Clustering

- Use `FindNeighbors()` to compute the graph of nearest neighbours.
  Which principal components are used by default?
  Instead, specify the set of principal components that you have chosen earlier.

```{r}
seurat_after_qc <- FindNeighbors(   )
```

> Answer:
> 
> The help page states that the function `FindNeighbors()` uses principal components 1 through 10, by default.

- Use `Graphs()` to display the names of the nearest neighbour graphs that are now stored in the Seurat object.

```{r}

```

- Use `FindClusters()` to identify clusters in the data set.
  What is the default setting for the `resolution` argument?
  Instead, set it to `0.5`.
  Do you expect more or fewer clusters following that change?
  What other parameters would you also try to experiment with?

```{r}
seurat_after_qc <- 
```

> 

- Use `UMAPPlot()` to visualise the cluster labels on the UMAP scatter plot.
  How would you describe the agreement between the UMAP layout and the clustering results?

```{r}

```

# Exercise

## Identify cluster markers

- Use `FindAllMarkers()` to identify positive markers for all clusters,
  keeping only markers that are detected in at least 25% of the target cluster,
  and with a log fold-change greater than `0.25`.
  Assign the result to an object named `seurat_markers_all`.
  What is the class of that object?
  How do you control the set of clusters that are used?

```{r}
seurat_markers_all <- FindAllMarkers(
    
    
    
    
)
class(seurat_markers_all)
```

> Answer:
> 

- Use `head()` to display the first few rows of the object `seurat_markers_all`.
  How do you read the contents of that object?
  How do you know which features are the markers of each cluster?

```{r}
head(seurat_markers_all)
```

> Answer:
> 

- Combine `subset()` and `head()` to filter and display the first few markers for cluster `3`.

```{r}

```

- Use `FeaturePlot()` to visualise the expression of the first 4 marker for cluster `3` on a UMAP layout.
  You may want to combine the function `subset()` and the `[]` operator to select the gene names to visualise.

```{r}

```

- Use `VlnPlot()` to visualise the same 4 markers as a violin plot.
  Do you have any particular preference between the two types of plots?

```{r}
VlnPlot(
    
    
    
)
```

> Answer:
> 

- Use `DoHeatmap()` to visualise the top 10 (positive) markers for each cluster.
  You may want to use `dplyr::group_by()` and `dplyr::slice_max()` to select the genes to visualise.
  You may also want to use `unique()` to avoid any duplicated gene names in the cluster markers.

```{r}
markers_top10_clusters <- seurat_markers_all %>%
    
    
DoHeatmap(
    
    
)
```
