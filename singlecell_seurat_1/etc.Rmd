- Most of the time, you will start from FASTQ files.

- [cellranger count](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/count)
  is the method officially supported by 10x Genomics.

- Other methods include
  [salmon alevin](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/alevin.html) and
  [kallisto | bustools](https://www.kallistobus.tools/).

In all cases, the objective of quantification is to produce a matrix of UMI counts,
for each feature and each barcode (i.e., cell).

That matrix is the starting point of your analysis using `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("Seurat")`.

# Accessing the contents of a Seurat object

Functions designed to access and interact the contents of a Seurat object are stored in a separate package
called `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("SeuratObject")`.

- `DefaultAssay()` returns the name of the "active" assay, used by default if unspecified.

- `Assays()` returns the names of the available assays.

- `[[` is a versatile function used to fetch one assay object or one column of cell metadata as a `data.frame`.
  Get all the metadata using empty brackets, i.e. `seurat_object[[]]`.

- `FetchData()` is a generalised version of `[[` that returns multiple pieces of per-cell information as a `data.frame` (e.g., feature expression, dimensionality reduction coordinates, metadata).

> You will need to know the names of the variables available in the various components of your own Seurat object.

- `$` is used to access one column of cell metadata as a `vector`.

- `GetAssayData()` returns the (sparse) matrix for a given assay.

... but a lot of the slots do not have dedicated functions.
Instead they are directly accessed using `@`, e.g. `seurat_object@project.name`.

---

# Cell identities

Seurat refers to cell identities as an umbrella for a number of things,
from experimental conditions to cluster labels.

- Sorted cells already have some form of identity.
  
- Clustering at different resolutions produce different set of labels (i.e., different "identities").

Seurat stores the "active" identity of cells in a dedicated slot of the object.

- `Idents()` returns the "active" identity of the cells.

- `Idents(seurat_object) <- "name"` assigns the metadata column called `"name"` as the active identity.

- `SetIdent(object, cells = NULL, value)` can be used to assign a new identity to certain cells, e.g.

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
SetIdent(seurat_object, cells = 1:10, value = 'B')
```


See `help("Idents", package = "SeuratObject")`.

---

# Exercise

## Accessing the contents of a Seurat object

- Query the name of the default assay in the Seurat object.

- List the names of assays available in the Seurat object.

- Display the first six rows and six columns of the RNA assay data.
  What function do you use?
  Which arguments do you need to supply, and which ones are optional?

- Display the entire data.frame of per-cell metadata (first six rows).
  What column names do you see?

- Fetch one column of metadata using `[[`.
  What type of object do you get back?

- Instead, fetch the same column of metadata using `$`.
  What type of object do you get back this time?

- Use the function `FetchData()` to access the library size and expression of the feature named `"LYZ"` (first six rows).
  What type of object do you get back?

---

# Common operations on Seurat objects

- `WhichCells()` returns the names of cells that match a logical expression.

> e.g. `WhichCells(seurat_object, expression = LYZ > 500)`

- `VariableFeatures()` returns the names of variable features (for a given assay, if computed).

- `subset()` returns a new Seurat object restricted to certain features and cells.

Those functions are often combined together, to achieve the desired result.
For instance:

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
subset(
    x = seurat_object,
    cells = WhichCells(seurat_object, expression = LYZ > 500),
    features = VariableFeatures(object = seurat_object)
)
```

- `merge()` combines the information from two Seurat objects into one.

... and more miscellaneous functions such as `colMeans()`, `colSums()`, `rowMeans()` and `rowSums()`.
See `help("Seurat-methods")`.

# Computing metrics for quality control

- `PercentageFeatureSet()` computes the fraction of reads assigned to a subset of genes, for each cell.

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
PercentageFeatureSet(seurat_object, pattern = "^CCL|^CXCL")
```

- `VlnPlot()` produces a violin plot for a selection of per-cell features, including gene expression, quality control metrics, and dimensionality reduction results available in a Seurat object.

- `FeatureScatter()` produces a scatter plot of two per-cell features,
  e.g., two features, a feature and quality control metric.

# Exercise

## Quality control and visualisation

- The library size and number of features detected per cell is already present in the Seurat object.
  Use the function `VlnPlot()` to display them in a single violin plot.

- Use the function `PercentageFeatureSet()` to compute the fraction of reads assigned to mitochondrial genes in each cell.
  Store the metric in the cell metadata of the Seurat object, under the name `"percent_mt"`.
  Visualise this new metric alongside the previous two in a new violin plot.

- Visualise a scatter plot of the proportion of mitochondrial UMIs against the library size in each cell.

- Create a new Seurat object, called `seurat_after_qc`, that is subsetted to cells that have more than 4,500 UMI counts, less than 15% of UMI counts assigned to mitochondrial features, and more than 1,500 features detected.
  How many cells were removed in this step?

# Normalisation and transformation strategies

## Standard transformation and normalisation methods

- `NormalizeData()` provides a choice of standard normalisation strategies:

  + `"LogNormalize"`, based on the library size for each cell.
  
  + `"CLR"`, assumes an overall fixed abundance in all cells.
  
  + `"RC"` (relative counts), `"LogNormalize"` without the "Log".

## sctransform

- `SCTransform()` implements a new normalisation strategy that replaces the commands `NormalizeData()`, `ScaleData()`, and `FindVariableFeatures()`.

This is an advanced topic that will be demonstrated and discussed later in the course.

# Identifying variable features in Seurat

- `FindVariableFeatures()` identifies features that show the highest amount of variability relative to their mean expression.

- `VariableFeaturePlot()` produces a "mean-variance" scatter plot that is good for diagnostics.

.pull-left[
```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=4}
ggplot(HVFInfo(seurat_object), aes(mean, variance)) +
  geom_point() +

```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=4, warning=FALSE}
VariableFeaturePlot(seurat_object)
```
]

Heteroscedasticity: feature with higher mean expression naturally have room for larger variance.

---

# Scaling data

Many methods for downstream analysis work better when features are brought back to a comparable range of values.

- Features naturally present different dynamic ranges.

- Biologically important features do not necessarily vary by a large absolute amount.

`ScaleData()` scales and centers features.

- Cell metadata and quality metrics can be regressed out to remove unwanted sources of variation (e.g. batch effects and technical artifacts).

---

# Exercise

## Variable features and scaling

- Identify variable features in the normalised RNA assay of the Seurat object.
  Use the `"vst"` method and select the 2,000 most variable features.
  What does this subsetting do, and what are our motivations for doing it?

- What is the function to display the name of variable features in a Seurat object (first ten)?
  How can you control which assay the variable features are pull from?

- Use the function `VariableFeaturePlot()` to visualise the scatter plot of standardised variance against average expression.
  How would you use this plot?

- Scale the normalised RNA assay of the Seurat object, regressing the library size and the fraction of UMI counts assigned to mitochondrial features.

# Dimensionality reduction

By nature, omics data sets survey a large number of features (e.g., tens of thousands of known genes in the human genome).

- High dimensionality is prohibitively costly in time to generate and visualise all (pairs of) features.

- Dimensionality reduction techniques identify/compute a smaller number of dimensions that summarise major axes of variation in the data.

  + e.g.,
    [PCA](https://doi.org/10.1080/14786440109462720),
    [t-SNE](http://jmlr.org/papers/v9/vandermaaten08a.html),

# Dimensionality reduction in Seurat

- `RunPCA()` runs a principal component analysis and stores the output inside the Seurat object itself.

- `PCAPlot()` displays a scatter plot of two principal components.

- `DimPlot()` is a versatile function used to plot any dimensionality reduction result available in the object, e.g.

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
DimPlot(..., reduction = "pca", ...)
```

- Other specialised functions are available, e.g. `TSNEPlot()`, `UMAPPlot()`.

- `Reductions()` returns the names of the available dimensionality reduction results.

- `ElbowPlot()` describes the amount of variance explained by the top principal components.

---

# Exercise

## Dimensionality reduction

- Run a principal component analysis on the Seurat object.
  Which features are used by the method in the default settings?
  How could you change this?
  How do you read the message output of the function `RunPCA()`?

- List the names of dimensionality reduction results available in the Seurat object.

- Use `PCAPlot()` or `DimPlot()` to produce a scatterplot of the first and second PCA components.

- Extract the first and second PCA components from the Seurat object as a `data.frame`.

## Bonus

- Make a scatterplot of the first and second PCA components yourself using `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("ggplot2")`.

- Run the UMAP technique on the first 20 principal components stored in the Seurat object and visualise the result as a scatterplot.

# Clustering in Seurat

By nature, clustering requires algorithms to compare cells to one another.
Increasingly large data sets are prohibitively costly in time and memory to compute the distance between every pair of data points.

- `FindNeighbors()` identifies the $k$ nearest neighbours for each data point.
  Subsequent steps will only consider those nearest neighbours, saving time and memory.

- `FindClusters()` identifies clusters using an algorithm that processes a graph of shared nearest neighbours (SNN).

- `DimPlot(..., label = TRUE, ...)` adds active identities as labels at the average coordinate of each group of cells.

## Accessing results

- `Graphs()` returns the names of available graphs in the Seurat object.

- Cluster labels are stored as cell metadata.

- The latest run `FindClusters()` overwrites the metadata column `seurat_clusters`, in addition to storing labels in its own column of metadata.

---

# Exercise

## Clustering

- First, visualise the amount of variance explained the top principal components (number of your choice).
  How many principal components would you use for downstream analyses?

- Then, compute the graph of nearest neighbours using the function `FindNeighbors()`.
  Which principal components are used by default?
  Instead, specify the number of components that you have chosen.

- What are the names of the nearest neighbour graphs that are now stored in the Seurat object?

- Finally, compute cluster labels.
  What is the default setting for the `resolution` argument?
  Instead, set it to `0.5`.
  Do you expect more or fewer clusters following that change?
  What other parameters would you also try to experiment with?

- Visualise the cluster labels on the UMAP scatter plot.
  How would you describe the agreement between the UMAP layout and the clustering results?

# Identify cluster markers

The interpretability of clusters relies on the ability to identify features acting as markers (positive or negative) that distinguish clusters from each other.

- The quality of markers depends on the quality of clustering, which in turns depends on every choice made in earlier steps of the analysis.

- Clustering, marker identification, and downstream analyses often form an iterative process to achieve sensible and interpretable results.

# Identifying cluster markers in Seurat

- `FindAllMarkers()` tests features for differential expression between each cell identity and all other cell identities.

- `FindMarkers()` performs a single comparison between two sets of cells.

  + If only one group of cells is given, it is implied that the second group comprises every other cell in the data set.

- `FindConservedMarkers()` takes an additional grouping variable from the cell metadata (e.g., batch),
  performs differential expression for each cluster within each level of the grouping variable, 
  and identifies markers that are robust for each cell identity across the groups.

- `FeaturePlot()` is similar to `DimPlot()` but specialises in coloring data points with feature data (rather than cell metadata).

- `DoHeatmap()` conveniently summarises the top markers for each cluster in a single view.

---

# Exercise

## Identify cluster markers

- Identify positive markers for all clusters,
  filtering markers that are detected in at least 25% of the cluster,
  and with a log fold-change greater than `0.25`.
  How do you control the set of clusters that are used?

- How do you read the contents of the object `seurat_markers_all`?
  How do you know which features are the markers of each cluster?

- Filter and display the top 10 markers for cluster 3.

- Visualise the expression of the top 4 marker for cluster 3 on a UMAP layout.

- Visualise the expression of those same 4 marker as a violin plot.

- Use `DoHeatmap()` to visualise the top 10 (positive) markers for each cluster.
  Hint: you may want to use the function `dplyr::group_by()`.
