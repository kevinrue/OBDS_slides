## Integration without correction

First, we will combine two PBMC data sets without any integration method.

### Import data sets

Import the two PBMC data sets from the files `pbmcv2_filtered.rds` and `pbmcv3_filtered.rds`.

The RDS files contain object that have already been processed through quality control and filtering, as seen in the Seurat day 1 lesson.

```{r}
pbmcv2 <- readRDS("data/pbmcv2_filtered.rds")
pbmcv3 <- readRDS("data/pbmcv3_filtered.rds")
```

### Sanity check

Use the `VlnPlot()` function to visualise the distribution of quality control metrics in the data sets given to you.

It is generally good practice to inspect data sets given to you before taking them any further.

**Hint:**

- Call `VlnPlot()` once for each data set.
- For each data set, focus on the features 'nFeature_RNA', 'nCount_RNA', and 'percent.mt'.

```{r}
plot1 <- VlnPlot(pbmcv2, features = c("nFeature_RNA", "nCount_RNA", "percent.mt"))
plot2 <- VlnPlot(pbmcv3, features = c("nFeature_RNA", "nCount_RNA", "percent.mt"))
cowplot::plot_grid(plot1, plot2, ncol = 1)
```

**Can you spot any issue between the two samples?**

> Answer:
> All quality control features seems to reach higher ranges of values in the 'pbmcv3' sample.

### Merge Seurat objects without correction

Use the `merge()` function to create a Seurat object that merges the two data sets without apply any sort of batch correction.

**Hint:**

- Refer to the Seurat tutorial at <https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/merge_vignette.html>.
- Consider using the argument `add.cell.ids=` to identify cells for each sample of origin in the merged object.

```{r}
pbmc_merged <- merge(
  x = pbmcv2,
  y = pbmcv3,
  add.cell.ids = c("v2", "v3")
)
pbmc_merged
```

Compare the dimensions of the merged Seurat object to those of the two original objects.

```{r}
dim(pbmc_merged)
```

```{r}
dim(pbmcv2)
```

```{r}
dim(pbmcv3)
```

**How do you think the number of features relate across the various objects?**

> Answer:
> The number of features largely overlaps.
> The merged data set contains the union of features observed in all input data sets.
> Features not present in either data set are simply assigned zero counts in the merged object.

### Perform SCTransform normalisation

Do you want to regress any meta.data variables ?

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
pbmc_merged <- SCTransform(
  object = pbmc_merged,
  vars.to.regress = "percent.mt"
)
pbmc_merged
```

Use the `VlnPlot()` to compare the distribution of 'nCount' in the RNA and SCT assays, showing cells from the two samples of origin in separate violins.

**Hint:**

- Look at the help page of the function to use the arguments `features=` and `group.by=` correctly.

```{r}
VlnPlot(
  object = pbmc_merged,
  features = c("nCount_RNA", "nCount_SCT"),
  pt.size = 0.02,
  same.y.lims = TRUE,
  group.by = "orig.ident"
)
```

**How good a job did SCT for the normalisation of sequencing depth between the two data sets, in the merged object?**

> Answer:
> Not too bad, although a shift is still visible.

Make sure the default assay is set to 'SCT'.

```{r}
DefaultAssay(pbmc_merged) <- "SCT"
```

### PCA

Run PCA.

```{r}
pbmc_merged <- RunPCA(pbmc_merged)
```

Visualise the scatter plot of the first two principal components.

```{r}
DimPlot(pbmc_merged)
```

**Can you see a batch effect between the two samples?**

> Answer:
> Yup (sad face).
> What's worse the batch effect is visible along the first principal component,
> meaning it accounts for most of the variance in the data set.

Use the function `ElbowPlot()` to determine a good number of principal components to use in the next steps.

```{r}
ElbowPlot(pbmc_merged, ndims = 50)
```

**How many principal components would you use?**

> Answer:
> We typically proceed with 20.

### UMAP

Run the UMAP technique on the chosen number of principal components.

```{r}
pbmc_merged <- RunUMAP(pbmc_merged, dims = 1:20)
```

Visualise the UMAP layout.

```{r}
DimPlot(pbmc_merged, group.by = "orig.ident")
```

**Can you still see the batch effect?**

> Answer:
> Sadly, yes.
> Note that we haven't done anything to correct for it since the PCA,
> so this is really not a surprise.

## Integration using SCTransform

**Hint:**

- Refer to the Seurat tutorial at <https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/integration_introduction.html#performing-integration-on-datasets-normalized-with-sctransform-1 >.
- The workflow of the 'Seurat v2' integration method varies depending on whether the data sets to merge were normalised using log-normalisation or SCTransform.
- In this exercise, we use the SCTransform approach (the tutorial above discusses both approaches).

### Import data sets

Import the two PBMC data sets (again!) from the files `pbmcv2_filtered.rds` and `pbmcv3_filtered.rds`.

For the purpose of this exercise, it is important to reset the input objects, to undo anything we nay have done to those objects in the previous exercise.

```{r}
pbmcv2 <- readRDS("data/pbmcv2_filtered.rds")
pbmcv3 <- readRDS("data/pbmcv3_filtered.rds")
```

### Preprocessing

Combine the two input Seurat objects into a named list.

```{r}
pbmc_list <- list("v2" = pbmcv2, "v3" = pbmcv3)
pbmc_list
```

Use `lapply()` to run SCTransform on each data set (separately) in the list.

**Hint:**

- The function `SCTransform()` must be given to the argument `FUN=`.
- The `...` argument of `lapply()` can be used to pass arguments to the function given to `FUN=`,
  e.g. `variable.features.n = 3000` and `vars.to.regress = "percent.mt"`

```{r}
pbmc_list <- lapply(
  X = pbmc_list,
  FUN = SCTransform,
  variable.features.n = 3000,
  vars.to.regress = "percent.mt"
)
pbmc_list
```

**What are the dimensions of each object in the list?**

> Answer:
> Object v2 shows "24528 features across 859 samples within 2 assays"
> Object v3 shows "28037 features across 778 samples within 2 assays"

**What is the default assay of each object in the list?**

> Answer:
> Object v2 shows "Active assay: SCT"
> Object v3 shows "Active assay: SCT"

### Select features for integration

Use the function `SelectIntegrationFeatures()` to select features to use for the integration of the two data sets.

**Note:**
This function scores features by the number of datasets they are deemed variable in, breaking ties by the median variable feature rank across data sets.
It returns the top scoring features according to that score.

```{r}
features_for_integration <- SelectIntegrationFeatures(
  object.list = pbmc_list,
  nfeatures = 3000
)
length(features_for_integration)
```

### Prepare a list of Seurat objects for integration

Use the function `PrepSCTIntegration()` to prepare the list of Seurat objects for integration.

**Note (from the help page):**
This function ensures that the sctransform residuals for the features specified to `anchor.features` are present in each object in the list.
This is necessary because the default behavior of `SCTransform()` is to only store the residuals for the features determined to be variable.
Residuals are recomputed for missing features using the stored model parameters via the `GetResidual()` function.

```{r}
pbmc_list <- PrepSCTIntegration(
  object.list = pbmc_list,
  anchor.features = features_for_integration
)
pbmc_list
```

### Integration

Use the function `FindIntegrationAnchors()` to find a set of anchors between a list of Seurat objects.
We will use these anchors to integrate the two objects in a subsequent step.

**Hint:**

- Look at the help page to specify the following arguments.
- Use the normalisation method 'SCT'.
- Use the first 30 dimensions of the CCA.

```{r}
anchors_for_integration <- FindIntegrationAnchors(
  object.list = pbmc_list,
  anchor.features = features_for_integration,
  normalization.method = "SCT",
  dims = 1:30,
  reduction = "cca"
)
anchors_for_integration
```

Use the function `IntegrateData()` to integrate the two objects.

**Hint:**

- Look at the help page to specify the following arguments.
- Use the normalisation method 'SCT'.
- Use the first 30 dimensions in the anchor weighting procedure.

```{r}
pbmc_integrated <- IntegrateData(
  anchorset = anchors_for_integration,
  dims = 1:30,
  normalization.method = "SCT"
)
pbmc_integrated
```

**Note:**

- If `normalization.method = "LogNormalize"`,
  the integrated data is returned to the `data` slot and can be treated as log-normalized, corrected data.
- If `normalization.method = "SCT"`, the integrated data is returned to the `scale.data` slot and can be treated as centered, corrected Pearson residuals.
- Refer to the 'Details' section of `?IntegrateData` for advice when integrating more than two samples. 

**What is the default assay now?**

```{r}
DefaultAssay(pbmc_integrated)
```

### Inspection and downstream analysis

Run PCA on the integrated object.

```{r}
pbmc_integrated <- RunPCA(pbmc_integrated, npcs = 50)
pbmc_integrated
```

Visualise the scatter plot of the first two principal components, and compare with the equivalent plot previously made for data integrated without correction.

```{r}
plot1 <- DimPlot(pbmc_merged, reduction = "pca")
plot2 <- DimPlot(pbmc_integrated, reduction = "pca")
plot1 + plot2
```

**How do the two plot compare?**

> Answer:
> Quite a bit better, though there is still some room for improvement.

Use `ElbowPlot()` to choose the number of principal components for downstream analyses.

```{r}
ElbowPlot(pbmc_integrated, ndims = 50)
```

**How many principal components woud you choose for downstream analyses?**

> Answer:
> We typically use 20 principal components.

Run the UMAP technique on the chosen number of principal components.

```{r}
pbmc_integrated <- RunUMAP(pbmc_integrated, dims = 1:20)
```

Run `FindNeighbors()` and `FindClusters()` on the integrated object.

**Hint:**

- Consider trying multiple resolutions at the same time (e.g., 0.5 and 0.8).

```{r}
pbmc_integrated <- FindNeighbors(pbmc_integrated, dims = 1:20)
pbmc_integrated <- FindClusters(pbmc_integrated, resolution = c(0.5, 0.8))
```

Check the number of clusters defined at each resolution.

**Hint:**

- You can use the `table()` function to tabulate the number of cells for a given resolution and to cross-tabulate the assignments of cells between two resolutions.

```{r}
table(pbmc_integrated$integrated_snn_res.0.5)
```


```{r}
table(
  "0.5" = pbmc_integrated$integrated_snn_res.0.5,
  "0.8" = pbmc_integrated$integrated_snn_res.0.8
)
```

Use the `DimPlot()` function to color cells by their sample of origin, and cluster assignment for selected resolutions.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 12
DimPlot(
  object = pbmc_integrated,
  reduction = "umap",
  group.by = c("orig.ident", "integrated_snn_res.0.5", "integrated_snn_res.0.8")
)
```

Use the function `FindAllMarkers()` to identify markers for each cluster at a chosen resolution.

**Hint:**

- Seurat documentation indicates that having used SCTransform v1, you must switch the default assay back to 'RNA' for the computation of cluster markers.
- You will also need to run `NormalizeData()`, as the 'RNA' assay has not been normalised since the data sets were integrated.
- You will also need to set the identity of cells to the desired clustering result prior to using `FindAllMarkers()`, as that function does not have any argument to specify the set of clusters to use.
- You will also need to specify `latent.vars = "orig.ident"` to regress the average effect of the sample of origin in the 'RNA' data, as `NormalizeData()` cannot be used for that.
- Consider trying different values for `test.use=` argument, e.g. 'LR'.
- Consider setting the argument `only.pos = TRUE` to yield only positive markers for each cluster.

**Note:**

- Read the help page of the `FindAllMarkers()` function to learn why `latent.vars` may not have any effect when using certain methods to computer markers.
- You can find the pros and cons of various statistical tests in <https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4612>

```{r}
DefaultAssay(pbmc_integrated) <- "RNA"
pbmc_integrated <- NormalizeData(pbmc_integrated)
Idents(pbmc_integrated) <- pbmc_integrated[["integrated_snn_res.0.5"]]
pbmc_integrated_markers <- FindAllMarkers(
  object = pbmc_integrated,
  test.use = "LR",
  latent.vars = "orig.ident",
  only.pos = TRUE
)
head(pbmc_integrated_markers)
```

Visualise the top five markers by log fold-change of each cluster in a heat map.

**Hint:**

- The functions `dplyr::group_by()` and `dplyr::slice_max()` can be used to extract the genes with the highest log fold-change in each cluster.
- Save those gene symbols in a character vector.
- Supply that vector of gene symbols to the function `DoHeatmap()`.
- Consider using `unique()` to remove duplicates (if any).
- Consider using the first code chunk below to identify the gene symbols to plot,
  and the second code chunk to display the heat map.
- Remember to set the default assay to 'SCT' prior to displaying the heat map,
  so that the heat map uses the `scale.data` slot of that assay.

**Note:**

- You could also run `ScaleData()` on the 'RNA' assay.

```{r}
markers_for_heatmap <- pbmc_integrated_markers %>%
  group_by(cluster) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = avg_log2FC, n = 5) %>% 
  pull(gene) %>% 
  unique()
markers_for_heatmap
```

```{r}
DefaultAssay(pbmc_integrated) <- "SCT"
DoHeatmap(
  object = pbmc_integrated,
  features = markers_for_heatmap
)
```

Based on the information collected so far (and other plots from your own initiative):

- How well do you think the clustering has worked?
- Are you able to identify each cluster?
- Would you re-evaluate any of the clusters?

> Answer:
> The resolution of 0.5 used in this solution seems to produce clusters that share groups of markers.
> This typically suggest over-clustering, whereby 'real' clusters have been fragmented into two or more clusters by an excessively high 'resolution' parameter.
> However, more detailed analyses may be required to ascertain that those additional cluster are not indeed 'real' sub-populations worthy of being analysed separately.

## Integration with Harmony

### Import data sets

Import the two PBMC data sets (again!) from the files `pbmcv2_filtered.rds` and `pbmcv3_filtered.rds`.

For the purpose of this exercise, it is important to reset the input objects, to undo anything we nay have done to those objects in the previous exercise.

```{r}
pbmcv2 <- readRDS("data/pbmcv2_filtered.rds")
pbmcv3 <- readRDS("data/pbmcv3_filtered.rds")
```

### Merge Seurat objects without integration

```{r}
pbmc_merged <- merge(x = pbmcv2, y = pbmcv3)
pbmc_merged
```

Run SCTransform.

```{r}
pbmc_merged <- SCTransform(pbmc_merged)
pbmc_merged
```

Run PCA and UMAP.

```{r}
pbmc_merged <- RunPCA(pbmc_merged)
pbmc_merged
```

```{r}
ElbowPlot(pbmc_merged, ndims = 50)
```

Run UMAP.

```{r}
pbmc_merged <- RunUMAP(pbmc_merged, dims = 1:20)
pbmc_merged
```

Plot the UMAP coloured by sample of origin (for a brief inspection prior to integration).

```{r}
DimPlot(pbmc_merged, group.by = "orig.ident")
```

Run Harmony.

**Hint:**

- Assign the output of the `RunHarmony()` function to a different name,
  so that you can later compare the data set before and after integration.
- Look at the help page to identify the argument that specifies the metadata field representing the groups of cells to integrate.
- Set `plot_convergence=TRUE`.
  What does this do?
- Set `dims.use=1:20`.
  What does this do?
- Make sure the function uses the 'SCT' assay.

```{r}
pbmc_harmony <- RunHarmony(
  object = pbmc_merged,
  group.by.vars = "orig.ident",
  plot_convergence = TRUE,
  dims.use = 1:20,
  assay.use = "SCT"
)
pbmc_harmony
```

Run `RunUMAP()`, `FindNeighbours()` and `FindClusters()` on the integrated object.

```{r}
pbmc_harmony <- RunUMAP(
  object = pbmc_harmony,
  reduction = "harmony",
  dims = 1:20,
  reduction.name = "harmony.umap"
)
pbmc_harmony <- FindNeighbors(
  object = pbmc_harmony,
  reduction = "harmony",
  dims = 1:20
)
pbmc_harmony <- FindClusters(pbmc_harmony)
pbmc_harmony
```

Visualise clusters and batches in the UMAP layout.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
plot1 <- DimPlot(
  object = pbmc_harmony,
  reduction = "harmony.umap",
  group.by = "SCT_snn_res.0.8",
  pt.size = 0.1
)
plot2 <- DimPlot(
  object = pbmc_harmony,
  reduction = "harmony.umap",
  group.by = "orig.ident",
  pt.size = 0.1
)
plot1 + plot2
```

**How does the Harmony integration compare with other methods so far (based on the UAMP alone...)?**

> Answer:
> The two samples look perfectly mixed, better than any other method so far in this lesson.
> Meanwhile, the clusters identified make sense visually, although whether they make biological sense would need to be ascertained by marker analysis.
