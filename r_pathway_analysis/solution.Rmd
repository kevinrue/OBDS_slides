- We will use the [**gprofiler2**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gprofiler2/index.html) R package to perform an over-representation analysis (ORA) on the output table of differentially expressed genes from DESeq2.

- The major aims of this exercise is to get you used to reading online tool documentation, playing with different parameters of the relevant functions and interpreting outputs.

### 1. Load libraries.

```{r}
options(bitmapType = 'cairo') # For rendering 
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(gprofiler2)
```

### 2. Read in output table of differentially expressed genes from DESeq2.

```{r}
all_genes_df <- read_csv("./data/dds_results.csv")
```
- Check its dimensions and look at the top of the file. What does that tell us about our table? 

```{r}
dim(all_genes_df)
```

```{r}
head(all_genes_df)  
```

### 3. Create input gene lists.

- Create these 3 data frames by subsetting the original one:
  + **all_genes_tested_df** object containing table of all genes tested in the differential expression analysis, which will be the background set
  + **upreg_genes_df** object containing all significantly upregulated genes ('padj' < 0.05 & 'log2FoldChange' > 1)
  + **downreg_genes_df** object containing all significantly downregulated genes ('padj' < 0.05 & 'log2FoldChange' < -1)

```{r}
all_genes_tested_df <- all_genes_df %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(padj))

# P-values set to NA are those from genes with all counts equal to zero (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#why-are-some-p-values-set-to-na)
  
upreg_genes_df <- all_genes_tested_df %>% 
                     dplyr::filter(padj < 0.05 & log2FoldChange > 1)

downreg_genes_df <- all_genes_tested_df %>% 
                       dplyr::filter(padj < 0.05 & log2FoldChange < -1)
```

- Check the dimensions of the data frames.

```{r}
dim(all_genes_df)
dim(all_genes_tested_df)
dim(upreg_genes_df)
dim(downreg_genes_df)
```

- From each of the 3 data frames, get a vector of the Ensembl ids.

```{r}
all_gene_tested_ids <- all_genes_tested_df %>% pull(gene_id)
upreg_gene_ids <- upreg_genes_df %>% pull(gene_id)
downreg_gene_ids <- downreg_genes_df %>% pull(gene_id)
```

### 4. Perform ORA using **gprofiler2**.

a. First, we want to do ORA on upregulated genes (vs. all genes tested as background). What function from gprofiler2 should we use? What parameters of that function should we include or change? Look at the [documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gprofiler2/vignettes/gprofiler2.html). 

```{r}
?gost() # Get help for function

# Write ORA query
gost_results_obj <- gost(query = upreg_gene_ids, 
                         organism = "mmusculus", 
                         ordered_query = FALSE,    
                         multi_query = FALSE, 
                         significant = TRUE, 
                         exclude_iea = TRUE, 
                         measure_underrepresentation = FALSE, 
                         evcodes = FALSE, 
                         user_threshold = 0.05, 
                         correction_method = "g_SCS",  
                         domain_scope = "custom_annotated",
                         custom_bg = all_gene_tested_ids, 
                         numeric_ns = "", 
                         sources = NULL, 
                         as_short_link = FALSE,
                         highlight = FALSE)
                         

# gost() parameters:

## `ordered_query` - Change to `TRUE` if input gene list is ranked; "testing is then performed iteratively, starting from the first gene and sequentially adding genes one by one" (kolberg_gprofiler2_2020)

## `exclude_iea` - Change to `TRUE` if we want to be stringent with gene sets considered i.e. only look at curated GO gene sets

## `correction_method = "g_SCS"` - This is their own multiple testing correction; more stringent than Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg, takes into account the unevenly distributed structure of functionally annotated gene sets

## `domain_scope = "custom_annotated"` - "Use the set of genes that are annotated in the data source and are also included in the user provided background list (documentation)"

## `sources` - "We recommend that initial pathway enrichment analyses includes only biological processes (BPs) of GO and molecular pathways of Reactome. Large pathways are of limited interpretative value, whereas numerous small pathways decrease the statistical power because of excessive multiple testing. (doi: 10.1038/s41596-018-0103-9)"

# gost() output coulumns:

## query_size - See gprofiler2 documentation

## precision - "the proportion of genes in the input list that are annotated to the function (defined as intersection_size/query_size)"

## recall - "the proportion of functionally annotated genes that the query recovers (defined as intersection_size/term_size)"

## effective_domain_size - Different per source when `domain_scope = "custom_annotated"` because number of genes annotated differs across sources

## source_order - "numeric order for the term within its data source (this is important for drawing the results)"; closely related terms are closer to each other in the order
```

- What type of object is the output? Explore contents.

```{r}
class(gost_results_obj)
summary(gost_results_obj)
```

b. Plot our results using a function from gprofiler2. Which one is it? 

```{r}
gostplot(gost_results_obj, capped = TRUE, interactive = TRUE)

## size of circle - term size
```

c. What does `as_short_link = FALSE` do in `gost()` function? 

```{r}
gost_results_obj_link <- gost(query = upreg_gene_ids, 
                         organism = "mmusculus", 
                         ordered_query = FALSE,    
                         multi_query = FALSE, 
                         significant = TRUE, 
                         exclude_iea = TRUE, 
                         measure_underrepresentation = FALSE, 
                         evcodes = FALSE, 
                         user_threshold = 0.05, 
                         correction_method = "g_SCS",  
                         domain_scope = "custom_annotated",
                         custom_bg = all_gene_tested_ids, 
                         numeric_ns = "", 
                         sources = NULL, 
                         as_short_link = TRUE,
                         highlight = FALSE)

gost_results_obj_link

# This gives you a url where you can quickly and easily visualise your data and send the link to others to see it too
# Check 'Detailed Results' tab; see g:Profiler docs (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/page/docs) to learn more about the website
```

d. Filter results table for gene sets with between 5-300 genes, inclusive. Examine results subset.

```{r}
gost_results_obj_filtered_df <- gost_results_obj$result
gost_results_obj_filtered_df <- gost_results_obj_filtered_df %>%
  filter(term_size >= 5 & term_size <= 300) %>% 
  arrange(p_value)

#

gost_results_obj_filtered <- gost_results_obj
gost_results_obj_filtered$result <- gost_results_obj_filtered_df
gostplot(gost_results_obj_filtered, capped = TRUE, interactive = TRUE)
```

e. Try querying multiple gene lists at the same time (up and down regulated genes) using the parameter to specify multiple queries.

```{r}
multi_gostquery_results_obj <- gost(query = list("upreg_genes" = upreg_gene_ids,
                                                 "downreg_genes"= downreg_gene_ids),
                                    organism = "mmusculus", 
                                    multi_query = TRUE,
                                    exclude_iea = TRUE, 
                                    correction_method = "g_SCS", 
                                    domain_scope = "custom_annotated",
                                    custom_bg = all_gene_tested_ids)
```

f. Can you plot these queries together?

```{r}
gostplot(multi_gostquery_results_obj, capped = TRUE, interactive = TRUE)
```

g. Output the `get_version_info()` to save the versions of the databases that were used for the analysis!
```{r}
get_version_info('mmusculus')
```

### 5. Output the `sessionInfo()` to have a record of packages used.

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

### 6. Knit your report into an HTML 

- This is good practise as it creates a permanent record of your plots/analysis outputs that you can share.
- This also makes sure your script runs without error from start to finish!
