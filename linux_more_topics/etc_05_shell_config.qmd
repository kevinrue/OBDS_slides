# Talk 2: Linux shell configuration

## Overview

- Shell configuration
- Aliases
- Environment variables e.g. the system path, $PATH
- Environment modules
- SSH and public-private keys for remote connection to a Linux server

## Shell configuration

- The file ~/.bashrc is a shell script that Bash runs whenever it is started interactively
  + A hidden file as its name starts with '.'; display with `ls -a`
  - Often edited to include commands that users wish to execute every time they log in, without the need to explicitly type them every time
 
- Typically, new accounts on Linux servers are created with an initial copy of ~/.bashrc file 

- Used to configure the shell environment
  + Set aliases (shortcuts)
  + Set environment variables
  + Load environment modules (not recommended)
  
<br>

- Sometimes, instead of directly editing the ~/.bashrc file, another configuration file, **~/.bash_aliases**, can be created and used for user-defined configuration
  + This file is also typically loaded automatically by the Bash shell
  + In this course, we will be modifying this file
 
## Aliases

- Shortcut for a command or series of commands
- Reduce keystrokes and improve efficiency
- While `alias` command can be used to define shortcuts interactively in the Bash session, aliases are most commonly defined in the ~/.bashrc file, to make them available as soon as users open a new shell
- Be mindful of overriding existing command name as aliases take precedence over commands of the same name

```
$ alias la='ls -alhF'       # Informative listing of files
$ alias rm='rm -i'          # Force an interactive prompt before every removal

$ alias wd='cd </path/to/working_dir/> && pwd && ls
```

## Environment variables

- A variable is a named place in a computer’s memory that stores a particular piece of information (e.g. number, string)
- Environment variables are defined and available in the shell’s environment
- Can be accessed by any program run in the shell
- Can be accessed using '\$' followed by variable name e.g. $USER

## Environment variables

- Can be user defined and modified
  + A number of environment variables are often already available in the Bash session

```
$ echo $HOME            # Set for each user to their own home directory
$ echo $USER            # Username
$ printenv USER         # Print $USER
```

<!-- $ ls $HOME              # Use in commands -->
<!-- $ echo $USER            # Set for each user to their own username -->
<!-- $ mkdir $USER -->
<!-- $ printenv              # Print currently defined environment variables -->

- Above are among the most commonly used variables but users can define any number of custom variable names using `export`
- Some programs might expect users to define additional environment variables

```
export TMP="$HOME"      # Not set by default, preferably define in ~/.bashrc
```

## Environment variables - System path ($PATH)

- One of the most important environment variable
- Stored as a colon-separated (:) character string that represents the list of directories that are searched – in the given order – to find executable files that are invoked by users and their scripts

```
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin:/home/l/ltamon/edirect:/home/l/ltamon/.local/bin:/home/l/ltamon/bin
```

- If the wanted program is not in the list of directories, it will not run
- Modify to add directories or remove directories (e.g. when a command is defined in multiple directories)
- Alternatively, you can provide the full path to the program you wish to run
- Whenever possible, we recommend using `module` to add and remove programs (i.e. modules) from the $PATH

## Environment modules

- Provide a central install of software available to multiple users on the same computer system 
- Dynamic modification of a user’s shell environment via modulefiles
  + Modulefiles are created by the system administrator to instruct `module` how software will be loaded or configured e.g. adding path of software to environment variable, $PATH
  + New modules can be requested from system administrators 

```
$ module avail                              # List modules currently available
$ module <avail | search> python            # Search for specific pattern of 
                                              module names 
$ module list                               # List modules currently loaded
$ module <add | load>                       # Add or load modules 
$ module load fastqc/0.11.9 bowtie2/2.4.2   # Load multiple modules
$ module unload <module name>               # Unload 
$ module purge                              # Unload all loaded modules 
```

## Remote connection to a Linux server

- We can log into a remote target host using `ssh`
- SSH (secure shell) is an encrypted network protocol for establishing a secure remote connection to a target host
- Simply put, the protocol uses a username and password to authenticate a user on the target host
  ```
  $ ssh <target username>@<target host>
  ```
  + If prompted for authenticity of host and whether to continue connecting, type 'yes' (usually appears when connecting the first time)
  + This then prompts for the password for the user account on target host 

## Remote connection to a Linux server *via* a jump host

- Sometimes, the connection has to be through a jump (bastion / proxy) host as an intermediary or gateway for extra security

```
$ ssh -J <jump username>@<jump host> <target username>@<target host> 

# OR

$ ssh -o ProxyJump=<jump username>@<jump host> <target username>@<target host>
```

<br>

- To connect to the OBDS server (obds), we do need to use University VPN and go through the WIMM jump host (bastion.imm.ox.ac.uk)

  ```
  $ ssh -o ProxyJump=<username>@bastion.imm.ox.ac.uk <target username>@obds
  ```
  + If prompted for authenticity of host and whether to continue connecting, type 'yes'
  + **This then prompts for 2 passwords**, 1 for the jump host and 1 for the target host, that should be entered every time you want to connect
  + <span style="color:red;">For people within the University, the username is your SSO for both hosts</span>

## Remote connection to a Linux server

- Typing the `ssh` command and all its options works on the command line 
  + but could be tedious especially when using a jump host as in our case and needing to repeatedly connect
- To minimise typing when connecting to a remote target host, we can:
  + Use an **SSH public-private key pair (SSH key)** **(1)** to avoid repeatedly entering passwords, which are likely hard to remember for security purposes, and **(2)** to enhance security e.g. not prone to password-guessing attacks
  + Use an **SSH config file** to store SSH connection details to multiple target hosts and accessing them using host shortcuts or nicknames, instead of typing long `ssh` commands
  + <span style="color:red;">Note that these two are independent, you can do either or both! We will do both of course!</span>
  
## Setting up a public-private key pair

- An SSH key pair consists of two parts:
  + A **private** key (a file) on your local home directory 
  + A **public** key (a file), which is copied to the remote host you are connecting to 
- These two files enable your personal computer and the target host to identify each other

## Advanced shell configuration 

- You may come across other Bash startup files other than ~/.bashrc e.g. ~/.profile, ~/.bash_profile

- Those other files perform a task similar to ~/.bashrc, but with subtle differences with respect to the order and the environment in which they are executed

- <span style="color:red;">We strongly discourage users from editing or creating those other files, stick with editing ~/.bashrc!</span>

## Advanced shell configuration - ~/.inputrc file

- This file allows you to customise how keystrokes are interpreted in the terminal emulator
- Like ~/.bashrc, it is a hidden file in the home directory that is applied on login
- Common shortcuts added to ~/.inputrc are:
  + In case of ambiguity when using tab completion, display options right away instead of asking whether to display them or not
  ```
  set show-all-if-ambiguous on
  ```
  
  + Search history of commands (forward or backward) starting with the pattern you typed (could be a command therefore)
  + "\<key combination>":\<command>
  
  ```
  "\e[A":history-search-backward
  "\e[B":history-search-forward
  ```
