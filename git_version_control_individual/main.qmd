## The `.git` subdirectory

Change directory to your new local clone of the repository, and list its contents.
For instance:

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
cd OBDS_Month_YEAR
ls -a
```

```
.  ..  .git  README.md
```

<br/>

Git uses the `.git` sub-directory to store all the information about the project history.
You can have a brief look for yourself if you wish.
Make sure that you do not alter or remove anything in that sub-directory.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ls -a .git/
```

<br/>

#### Result

- Deleting the `.git` sub-directory is effectively discarding the _history_ of changes made to the repository.
- However, deleting the `.git` sub-directory does not affect the _current state_ of the other sub-directories and files that make up your project (e.g., `README.md`).

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
**Changes are stored separately from the files themselves.**
:::

## Ignore files

One or more special files named `.gitignore` can be placed in your repository.

Each line in those file specifies a file name or pattern that <i class="fab fa-git"></i> will ignore (i.e., not track) *in the future*.

::: {.callout-note}
Files that are already tracked will continue to be tracked even after they are added to `.gitignore`, unless they are explicitly removed from the repository using `git rm` (use the `--cached` option to only remove the file from the _index_, but keep the file itself).
:::

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
```
## .gitignore

 .DS_Store
 data/
 *fastq.gz
 *sam
 *bam
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```

```
:::

::::

**Can you tell which files will be tracked when this `.gitignore` exists in the project root directory?**

## Status of a repository

The `git status` sub-command can be used to check whether the repository is up-to-date.

<br/>

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## Exercise

### Make changes

Create a file named `.gitignore` in your repository
using the `nano` or `vi` command line text editors in the Bash terminal:

```bash
nano .gitignore
# or
vi .gitignore
```

<br/>

Add a commented line to that file, starting with `#` (hashtag), e.g.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# This file list paths and patterns to ignore from version control
```

<br/>

Run `git status` again.

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
**What does the command return this time? How do you interpret it?**
:::

## Untracked files

Here is an example output of `git status`, after adding a new file `.gitignore`.

```
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .gitignore

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

<br/>

The message indicates that a new file named `.gitignore` is detected in the repository.
It also indicates that the command `git add` may be used to track the file.

knitr::include_graphics("img/git-untracked.svg")
```

## Track new files

The `git add` sub-command can be used to add new sets of changes to the *staging area*.

- The *staging area* is used to prepare the set of changes that will be recorded in the next *commit*.
- The command adds filenames to the staging area, but only the *changes* in those files will be recorded.
- In this case, we add a brand new file to the staging area, so the whole contents of the new file constitute the changes (relative to no file).

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git add .gitignore
$ git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   .gitignore
```

<br/>

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
**What changed in `git status` after running `git add`?**
:::

## The staging area

We just ran `git add`, which added a set of changes to the _staging area_.

Then, we ran `git status`, as it is always a good idea to inspect the state of the repository to ensure everything is as expected before taking any further action.

The `git commit` sub-command can be used to add changes currently in the _staging area_ in the next _commit_ of the _repository_.

- The contents of the _staging area_ are added to a new _commit_ in the repository.
- The _staging area_ itself is cleared, ready for the next set of changes to process.

knitr::include_graphics("img/carpentries-git-staging-area.svg")
```

## Record a set of changes 

The `git commit` sub-command can be used to record the changes that are currently in the _staging area_ in the next _commit_ of the _repository_.

- The `-m` option can be used to specify the message used to annotate the _commit_ that will contain this set of changes.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git commit -m "Added .gitignore file"
```

```
[main 81acf15] Added .gitignore file
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
```

#| out-width: 800px

knitr::include_graphics("img/git-commit.svg")
```

## Remotes

You have made a *commit* in the *clone* of the *repository* on the **teaching cluster**.

- The <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub *clone* of the *repository* does not about it yet.
- You need to *push* those updates from the teaching cluster to <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.height='300px', out.width='800px'}

#| out-height: 300px
#| out-width: 800px
## Source: Kevin Rue-Albrecht (Adobe Illustrator)
knitr::include_graphics("img/git-push.svg")
```

The histories of clones are not automatically synchronised.

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
**Can you imagine reasons why?**
:::

## Push commits to a remote

The `git push` sub-command can be used to send local changes to a _remote_ repository.

- The local repository must have configured the address of the _remote_ repository.
- When you create a repository as a _clone_ of a _remote_ repository,
  this is done automatically (the remote `origin` is created during initialisation).

Before we push, the `git remote` command can be used to inspect, add, and remove links to _remote_ repositories from the local repository configuration.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git remote -v
```

```
origin	git@github.com:kevinrue/OBDS_Month_YEAR.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:kevinrue/OBDS_Month_YEAR.git (push)
```

<br/>

When everything is in place, you can tell <i class="fab fa-git"></i> to push new commits from the local clone to a _remote_.
When calling `git push` without any other argument,
the default is to push from the current local branch to the corresponding branch on the _remote_ named `origin`.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git push
```

## Exercise

### Push commits to a remote

- Run `git push`.

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
**How do you read the output message? (example below)**
:::

```
$ git push
Enumerating objects: 3, done.
Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Delta compression using up to 40 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.

   81acf15..9e2b638  main -> main
```

<br/>

Alternatively, we could have used the following command to explicitly push
(the current branch) to the branch called `main` on the remote called `origin`
(for the same result).

```
git push origin main
```

## File size limit

> GitHub limits the size of files allowed in repositories. If you attempt to add or update a file that is larger than 50 MiB, you will receive a warning from Git. The changes will still successfully push to your repository, but you can consider removing the commit to minimize performance impact. For more information, see "Removing files from a repository's history."

## The repository history

The `git log` sub-command can be used to display the history of commits in the repository.

- The `--all` option forces <i class="fab fa-git"></i> to display the repository history across all the branches.
  + By default, <i class="fab fa-git"></i> only displays the history of the branch currently checked out.
- The `--graph` option adds a visual representation of branches in the repository, and their connections to each other.
- The `--oneline` (i.e., "one line") forces <i class="fab fa-git"></i> to summarise each commit as a single line.
  + This limits the information displayed, but helps with the visualisation.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
git log --all --graph --oneline
```

## View differences between commits

The `git diff` sub-command can be used to compare two states of the repository.

It is possible to compare all the changes between two commits using the syntax:

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
git diff old_commit new_commit
```

- The order of commit identifiers control the changes that are shown as "added" or "removed".
- Typically, the older commit is given first, so that "additions" were added in the more recent commit relative to the older commit.

It is also possible to compare the current state of files in the repository - including uncommitted changes - to any commit of the repository.

- This is often used to examine the changes that you have made since the most recent commit.

## Edit files on <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub

Files can be created and edited directly on <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub,
though only one file can be edited at a time in this way.
Saving the changes creates a new commit on <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub.

## Pull changes from a remote repository

Having just made changes to the files on <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub:

- This does not automatically update the files in your _clone(s)_ on clusters and personal computers.
- The changes need to be _pulled_ from <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub to the clone.
