# The `.git` subdirectory

Change directory to your new local clone of the repository, and list its contents.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ cd OBDS_May_2022
$ ls -a
```

```
.  ..  .git  README.md
```

Git uses the `.git` sub-directory to store all the information about the project history.
You can have a brief look for yourself if you wish.
Make sure that you do not alter or remove anything in that sub-directory.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ ls -a .git/
```

#### Result

- Deleting the `.git` sub-directory is effectively discarding the _history_ of changes made to the repository.
- However, deleting the `.git` sub-directory does not affect the _current state_ of the other sub-directories and files that make up your project (e.g., `README.md`).

.center[
**Changes are stored separately from the files themselves.**

# Ignore files

One or more special files named `.gitignore` can be placed in your project.

Each line in those file specifies a file name or pattern that <i class="fab fa-git"></i> will ignore (i.e., not track) in the future.

- Files that are already tracked will continue to be tracked even after they are added to `.gitignore`, unless they are explicitly removed from the repository using `git rm` (use the `--cached` option to only remove the file from the index, but keep the file itself).

.pull-left[
## .gitignore
```
 .DS_Store

 *fastq.gz
 *sam
 *bam
```

**Can you tell which files will be tracked when this `.gitignore` exists in the project root directory?**

# Status of a repository

The `git status` sub-command can be used to check whether the repository is up-to-date.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

---

# Exercise

## Make changes

- Create a file named `.gitignore` in your repository.

```bash
touch .gitignore
```

- Optionally, add a line to that file, e.g.

```
# This file list file patterns to ignore from version control
```

- Run `git status` again.

# Untracked files

Here is an example output of `git status`, after adding a new file `.gitignore`.

```
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .gitignore

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

---

# Track new files

The `git add` sub-command can be used to add new sets of changes to the _staging area_.

- The _staging area_ is used to prepare the set of changes that will be recorded in the next _commit_.
- The command adds filenames to the staging area, but only the changes in those files will be recorded.
- In this case, we add a new file to the staging area, so the whole contents of the new file constitute the changes (relative to no file).

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git add .gitignore
$ git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   .gitignore
```

.center[
**What changed in `git status` after running `git add`?**
]

# The staging area

We just ran `git add`, which added a set of changes to the _staging area_.

Then, we ran `git status`, as it is always a good idea to inspect the state of the repository to ensure everything is as expected before taking any further action.

The `git commit` sub-command can be used to add changes currently in the _staging area_ in the next _commit_ of the _repository_.

- The contents of the _staging area_ are added to a new _commit_ in the repository.
- The _staging area_ itself is cleared, ready for the next set of changes to process.

```

---

# Record a set of changes 

The `git commit` sub-command can be used to record the changes that are currently in the _staging area_ in the next _commit_ of the _repository_.

- The `-m` option can be used to specify the message used to annotate the _commit_ that will contain this set of changes. 

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git commit -m "Added empty .gitignore file"
```

```

# Remotes

You have made a _commit_ in the clone of the repository on the teaching cluster.

The histories

---

# Push commits to a remote

The `git push` sub-command can be used to send local changes to a remote repository.

- The local repository must have configured the address of the remote repository.
- When you create a repository as a _clone_ of a remote repository,
  this is done automatically (the remote `origin` is recorded during initialisation).

Before we push, the `git remote` command can be used to inspect, add, and remove remote repositories from the local repository configuration.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git remote -v
```

```
origin	git@github.com:kevinrue/OBDS_May_2022.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:kevinrue/OBDS_May_2022.git (push)
```

When everything is in place, you can tell <i class="fab fa-git"></i> to push new commits from the local clone to a remote.
When calling `git push` without any other argument,
the default is to push from the current branch to the corresponding branch on the remote named `origin`.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git push
```

---

# Exercise

## Push commits to a remote

- Run `git push`.

# The repository history

The `git log` sub-command can be used to display the history of commits in the repository.

- The `--all` option forces <i class="fab fa-git"></i> to display the repository history across all the branches.
  + By default, <i class="fab fa-git"></i> only displays the history of the branch currently checked out.
- The `--graph` option adds a visual representation of branches in the repository, and their connections to each other.
- The `--oneline` (i.e., "one line") forces <i class="fab fa-git"></i> to summarise each commit as a single line.
  + This limits the information displayed, but helps with the visualisation.

# View differences between commits

The `git diff` sub-command can be used to compare two states of the repository.

- It is possible to compare all the changes between a reference and a target commits using the syntax `git diff reference_commit target_commit`
  + The order of commit identifiers control the changes that are shown as "added" or "removed".
- It is also possible to compare the current state of files in the repository - including uncommitted changes - to any commit of the repository.
  + This is often used to examine the changes that you have made since the most recent commit.

  + README file(s)
  
  + LICENSE file, if any
  
- Optionally track:

  + `.gitignore` file(s)
  
  + Configuration file(s)

- Do not track output files.
]

.pull-right[
- Do not track very large files (e.g., data).

  + Use [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) if you must.

  + Host elsewhere
  (e.g.,
  [figshare](https://figshare.com/),
  [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)).
  
  + Download data at runtime.

- Do not track confidential information

  + e.g., login, passwords

So far, your repository has followed a linear timeline.

What if:

- You want to write (and test) two mutually exclusive changes to your code,
  and track those changes until you decide one to keep and one to discard.
- You need to backup work in progress while urgently fixing a bug.
- You do not want to commit draft code to the main branch of your repository.
]

Then:

- You can initiate new _branches_ in the history of your repository.

- Changes upstream of the branching point are shared; downstream changes are specific to each branch.

# Merging branches of history

.pull-right[
Creating branches will result in your work being spread in mutually exclusive versions of your files, e.g.

- The main branch contains the code from your latest lab meeting.
- Another branch includes code that generates a new figure.
- Another branch contains updates that fix a bug.
]

To generate a new version of your code that contains the code from your latest lab meeting,
**and** the bug fix, **and** the new figure, you need to _merge_ branches together.

Merging two branches creates a new _commit_ in the repository history.
Downstream of the merging point, the files contain the changes made in both upstream branches.

# Branching and merging

```{r, fig.align='center', out.height='300px'}
# Source: Kevin Rue-Albrecht (Adobe Illustrator)
knitr::include_graphics("img/branch-and-merge.svg")
```

- Branching allows you to work on different things independently from each other.

- Merging combines the changes made on a branch to those made on another branch.

  + Typically, "feature" branches are merged to the main branch.

- Branches can contain any number of commits before being merged.

- Branches do not have to be merged; they can be abandoned and deleted (great for experimenting).

---

# Create a branch

The `git branch` sub-command can be used to inspect and create branches in a repository.

- This does not automatically synchronise remote clones of the repository.

  + You will need to _push_ those branches to the remote clones.
  
- You can only create branches with named that are not already used (locally).

  + You will need to delete branches if you want to re-use their names.
  
- The branching point is the latest commit on the current branch.

The `git checkout` sub-command is used to switch between branches.

Frequently, `git checkout -b name_of_new_branch` is used to simultaneously
create **and** switch to that new branch.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.height='150px'}
# Source: Kevin Rue-Albrecht (Adobe Illustrator)
knitr::include_graphics("img/git-branch.svg")
```

---

# Merging a branch

The `git merge` sub-command can be used to merge two branches.

Most frequently, "feature" branches are merge to the main branch.

```
git checkout main     # checkout the "receiving" branch
git merge new_branch  # merge the "feature" branch to the current branch
```

This creates a new commit.
From that point, files contain the changes made in the two parent branches.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.height='150px'}
# Source: Kevin Rue-Albrecht (Adobe Illustrator)
knitr::include_graphics("img/git-merge.svg")
```

---

# Deleting a branch

Once merged, branches should be "deleted".

- Except the main branch!

- If the branch was merged, only the name  of the branch is deleted, not the commits.

  + The commits are part of the history of the other branch.
    Thus, commits are kept as long as one branch in the repository contains them.

- If the branch was not merged, the commits on that branch are lost.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.height='150px'}
# Source: Kevin Rue-Albrecht (Adobe Illustrator)
knitr::include_graphics("img/git-branch-delete.svg")
```

.center[

**What is the difference with the previous illustration?**
]

The name of the branch can then be re-used to create a new branch with that name.
