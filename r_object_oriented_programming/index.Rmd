# Lesson goals and objectives

## Learning goals

- Understand the concept of object-oriented programming.

- Describe how to access the contents of an S3 object.

- Identify methods that behave differently for objects of different classes.

- Develop good practices to name objects and functions in your <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> workspace.

## Learning objectives

- Create objects of various classes.

- Inspect their contents.

- Apply methods to objects of various classes.

---

# Prerequisites

<br/>

.x-large-list[
- A clone of the shared GitHub repository for this course.

- A working installation of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (4.0.3).

- A working installation of [git](https://git-scm.com/).

- A working installation of [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/).
]

---

# Set up

- Pull the `master` branch of the shared repository.

> We have added some files to get you started.

- In the daily sub-directory, make a copy of the `template` sub-directory with your HPC username.

> e.g. `cp -R template kevinrue`

The resulting file structure should look like the following:

```
  OBDS_Training_May_2021/
  |_ 3_r_genomics_data_science/
    |_ 1_oop/
      |_ README.md
      |_ oop.Rproj
```

- Launch the RStudio project `oop.Rproj` in your sub-directory.

# So far, in the course

## Procedural programming

- So far we have been using functions

- This is but one type of programming paradigm

.pull-right[
- Divide and conquer

- Readable

- Sustainable

- Easier to debug

- Reuse code

# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

.pull-left[
## Why Object Oriented Programming?

- Better code reusability
- Better security mechanisms
- More flexibility and scalability
]

.pull-right[
## In procedural programming:

- Decompose the problem into sub-problems
- Write _functions_ for each sub-problem
- Task oriented

## In object-oriented programming:

- Focus on _data_ rather than logic
- Use _objects_ / _classes_ to model real-world concepts
- Objects can communicate with each other
]

---

# Classes

.x-large-list[
- Classes represent real world object

- They contain data about the object (attributes)

- They have functions to manipulate that data (methods)

- They often have hierarchical relationships

# Analogy

- A _class_ is the generic description of an object
  
  + Like a recipe for a dish; or an entry in a dictionary.

- An _object_ is an instance of that class

  + Like one specific plate of food serve on a table.

# The four pillars of object oriented programming

- The OOP paradigm follows four principles.

Note: Individually described in next few slides

| Name | Description |
| - | - |
| polymorphism | refers to a programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class. |
| Encapsulation | describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit, e.g., a class. |
| Inheritance | is a mechanism where you can to derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods. |
| abstraction | refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation (e.g. someone driving a car doesn't need to know how an engine works -> API) |

# Inheritance

- Child classes inherit all the attributes and methods of their parent class(es).

- Child class can add their own new attributes and methods.

---

# Encapsulation

- Objects can keep their data private.

- The contents of an object can only be accessed by public methods.

- Improves security.

# Abstraction

- Expose only high level methods.

- Keep implementation details internal.

- Internal implementation can be changed without affecting other objects.

# Polymorphism

-  Attributes and public methods can be implemented differently for different classes and sub-classes.

# The S3 class system in <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>

Everything is an object in <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>.
For example, character vectors are objects.

.pull-left[
```{r, include=TRUE}
character_object <- "A"
character_object
str(character_object)
class(character_object)
attributes(character_object)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, include=TRUE}
character_object2 <- c("A", "B", "C")
character_object2
str(character_object2)
class(character_object2)
attributes(character_object2)
```
]

---

# Factors are objects, too

.pull-left[
```{r, include=TRUE}
factor_object <- factor(c("A", "B", "C"))
factor_object
str(factor_object)
class(factor_object)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, include=TRUE}
attributes(factor_object)
attr(factor_object, "levels")
attr(factor_object, "class")
```
]

---

# Data frames are objects

.pull-left[
```{r, include=TRUE}
dataframe_object <- data.frame(
  numbers = c(1, 2, 3),
  strings = c("A", "B", "C")
  )
dataframe_object
class(dataframe_object)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, include=TRUE}
str(dataframe_object)
attributes(dataframe_object)
```
]

---

# And matrices are objects

.pull-left[
```{r, include=TRUE}
matrix_object <- matrix(
  data = rbinom(8, 10, 0.5),
  nrow = 2
  )
matrix_object
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, include=TRUE}
class(matrix_object)
str(matrix_object)
attributes(matrix_object)
attr(matrix_object, "dim")
```
]

---

# S3 method dispatch

Methods are ordinary functions that use a special naming convention: `generic.class`:

.pull-left[
```{r}
options(width = 60)
```


```{r, include=TRUE}
methods("print") %>% head(14)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, include=TRUE}
print.factor(factor_object)
print.factor(character_object)
print.default(character_object)
```
]

.center[
**You can call methods directly, but you shouldn't!**
]

The whole point of method dispatch is that <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> uses the class of the object to determine the method to use.
