# Learning Goals & Objectives

### Learning goals

<!--
High-level "big picture" objectives of the learning process.
-->

- Understand what version control is and when to use it.
- Identify where git stores information.
- Practice how to record changes in git.

### Learning objectives

<!--
More concrete and measurable outputs.
-->

- Set up an SSH key pair.
- Configure Git.
- _Clone_ your own copy of the shared repository for this course.
- Edit files and _commit_ your changes.
- _Push_ your contributions to the shared repository.
- _Pull_ contributions from other participants in the shared repository.
- Examine the _log_ of the shared repository.

# Pre-requisites

- A [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

- Membership to the <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub organisation [OBDS-Training](https://github.com/OBDS-Training) .

- An account on the CCB cluster.

---

# Set up

- Connect to the University VPN.

- Open a terminal application on your computer.

- Connect to the CCB cluster over SSH.

# SSH key pairs

_We need to set an SSH key pair between the CCB cluster and GitHub._
]

# Exercise

## Setting up the SSH key pair

This key pair will allow your clone of the repository to push and pull code through the GitHub API.

- Open the Terminal application, and log into the CCB cluster.

- Create an SSH key pair.

  + `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`
  
  + _Do_ set a passphrase to protect your key pair.

- Display the public key and copy it.

  + `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

- Add the public key to your GitHub account.

  + <https://github.com/settings/ssh/new>

# Using <i class="fab fa-git"></i> as an HPC module

Use SSH to open a terminal on the HPC cluster.

The system executable of `git` is a rather old version.
Instead, a more recent version of `git` was installed as a module on the CCB cluster.

- Check that the module `git` is loaded.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ module list
```

- What is the path to the `git` executable?

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ which git
```

- What version of `git` is it?

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git --version
```

---

# Getting started with <i class="fab fa-git"></i>

The `git` command has many sub-commands, options, and flags.
You can run `git` alone to list the sub-commands and a short description of each.
How many sub-commands do you see?

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git
```

The `--version` flag asks `git` to print the version of the `git` executable that is used.
The <i class="fab fa-git"></i> program is generally backward compatible, but you may observe subtle differences in the way different version of <i class="fab fa-git"></i> display information.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git --version
```

You can access more detailed help for any sub-command using the `--help` flag.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git clone --help
```

```{r child='git-configure.Rmd'}
```

# Exercise

## Clone the shared repository

The `git clone` sub-command takes the address of a remote repository and creates a copy of that repository in a new local directory.


```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git clone git@github.com:OBDS-Training/OBDS_Training_Jan_2022.git
```

.pull-left[
```{r, fig.align='center', out.height='300px'}
# Source: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-clone
knitr::include_graphics("img/atlassian-clone.svg")
```
]

.pull-right[
But first, create a `git` subdirectory in your personal OBDS directory and change directory.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
mkdir /project/obds/$USER/git
cd /project/obds/$USER/git
```

Now, clone the repository into that `git` subdirectory.
